# 🚪 RFID-Door-Lock-Access-Control-System 🚪

Welcome to the repository for the RFID Door Lock Access Control System.

This system leverages RFID technology to enhance security in door lock systems. It reads user credentials, usually stored on a keycard or fob with an embedded RFID chip, to authorize or deny access.

## 📖 How It Works

1. The user's RFID tag contains a unique identifier.
2. When in proximity, the reader captures this identifier.
3. The identifier is then sent via antennas and transceivers for verification.
4. If the system recognizes the tag, access is granted; otherwise, it's denied.
5. Every access attempt, successful or not, is automatically logged, allowing for robust monitoring and tracking of entry activities.

## 🛠️ Materials Used

- **Module RFID-RC522**: The heart of the system responsible for reading RFID tags.
- **ESP32**: A versatile microcontroller handling data processing and system logic.
- **2 LED**: To indicate access (green for granted, red for denied).
- **Resistor**: For current regulation.
- **Breadboard**: To assemble and connect all components.
